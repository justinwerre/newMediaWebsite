				<ul>
					<li>Leave the gym, get Surf.</li>
					<li>Teach it to Marshtomp over Water Gun.</li>
					<li>Equip a Persim berry and heal to full.</li>
					<li>Surf on the South lake to the bottom right corner. Hidden in that corner is a rare candy. Pick it up, and Teleport all the way back to Mauville.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There is no need to take a shop here. But it's time to pick up Thunderbolt for Kyogre:</p>
				<p>To begin with, talk to Wattson in Mauville and accept the quest. Now head south down to the water's edge, use a Super Repel, and surf east to New Mauville itself, contained within a cave. Follow the path in the above map, picking up the item balls that block the third and fourth regular switches. Once you've hit the master switch, use an Escape Rope (you got one from one of the two item balls you picked up), then Teleport the rest of the way back to Mauville. Talk to Wattson again to receive his thanks and TM24 Thunderbolt.</p>

				<p>With that sidetrack over, it's now time to continue progressing. Head east from Mauville and down to the beach, dodging the rotating trainer in your way. You can dodge every trainer up to the Weather Institute. If you don't have a Flyer yet, surfing gives you a 35% encounter rate for Wingull. If you don't need one, use a Super Repel. Once you get there, fight the female Aqua Grunt.</p>

				<h3>Team Aqua Grunt 6</h3>
				<p>She is faster to fight than the other option you're given because she only has one pokemon. Mud Shot this Carvanha.</p>

				<p>Proceed up, and fight the next Grunt. Do not talk directly to him; you need him to take one step to admit you past the tables.</p>

				<h3>Team Aqua Grunt 7</h3>
				<p>You can use Strength on the Poochyena here, but the Carvanha still needs a Mud Shot to avoid Rough Skin text and damage as usual.</p>

				<h3>Aqua Admin Shelly</h3>
				<p>Carvanha gets another Mud Shot. Even at low SpA IVs, you should 2KO the Mightyena with Surf.</p>

				<p>Descend back to the ground floor of the Weather Institute and take a much deserved bed heal; your PP is probably suffering at this point. With this you should be ready for:</p>

				<h3>Rival 3</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Much easier this time around. You need to set up 2-3 X Attacks and 1-2 X Speeds before Grovyle, and this time Numel doesn't have Growl.</li>
					<li>You'll need to use 2 X Speeds if your Speed is 42 or less as of your last levelup, but if you have 43 or more, you get away with only one.</li>
					<li>After that, KO Numel &amp; Grovyle with Strength, and Wailmer with Mud Shot. Both Wailmer and Grovyle are damage ranges with 2 X Attacks at Level 31, and if you miss the Grovyle range you die to a seriously powerful Leaf Blade in return. Using a third X Attack is not a terrible idea to avoid this.</li>
