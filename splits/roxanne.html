				<p>Proceed back to Birch's Lab, walk up to your mom and talk to her to get the running shoes. The Treecko fight usually leaves you with a small amount of HP, so unless you got lucky, use that Potion you picked up before the next trainer battle. From this point, you have pokeballs, so if you find a Zigzagoon or a Poochyena, catch it to obtain your Rock Smash slave. </p>

				<h3>Youngster Calvin</h3>
				<p>Use Tackle. The Zigzagoon's best pattern is to use tail whip. It's worst pattern is repeated use of growl, which can be time consuming and lethal. Beware, it's strength is still comparable to yours, so an unlucky miss or crit can end it here.</p>

				<table>
					<tr><th>Item</th><th>Quantity</th></tr>
					<tr><td>Potion</td><td>1</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Repel</td><td>3</td></tr>
					<tr><td>X speed</td><td>1</td></tr>
					<tr><td>X attack</td><td>3</td></tr>
				</table>
				<p>Head to the gym and enjoy the catching tutorial, the only time in the run when your hands can leave the controller.</p>

				<h3>Petalburg Woods</h3>
				<p>Proceed along route 104 through the grass without using a repel. If you don't have a Rock Smash slave yet, this is your second to last chance. This is also the first opportunity to pick up Taillow and Wingull, two options for Flyers with a 10% encounter rate each. If you feel like you could use another potion, there is a hidden one on the top left patch of sand on the beach. It might come in handy. Proceed to pick the two Oran Berries on the top of the route. Use a repel right before you hit the grass (with optimal pathing, this makes the repel faded text stop you in a timely place, as you are about to turn). Potion or berry to full and enter Petalburg Woods. Pass Lyle, and move on to the next trainer.</p>

				<h3>Team Aqua Grunt 1</h3>
				<p>Use Tackle. At max attack, you kill the Poochyena in 5 hits (if you fought Lyle, this goes to 4). It outpaces you with its attack strength (again, less so after you fight Lyle), but this tends not to be the problem. Optimally, the Poochyena will use a combination of Howl and Tackle, but often you'll find yourself at the mercy of the infamous sand attack. Remember the accuracy curve (multiply by (3/(3+n)) where n is the number of sand attacks) and hope for the best.</p>

				<p>Dodge the next bug catcher. If you hit him without fighting Lyle, you won't be able to kill the Nincada in a reasonable amount of time. If you have fought Lyle, water gun will take care of it. After exiting the forest, talk to the guy on your left near the berry trees to get TM09 Bullet Seed, not a useful move for the run but a nice money bonus. If you feel like your health is below normal or you want more consistency, feel free to grab the two orans to the left. At the top of route 104 and on the right.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Talk to the old lady for a Chesto Berry.</li>
					<li>Grab the Leppa Berries above her to help replenish your PP later. Each one functions as an Ether, and getting the 2 berries here is easier than picking up 2 separate Ethers.</li>
					<li>Take the 2 Cheri Berries.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Every trainer on the rest of route 104 can and should be dodged. At the city itself, head straight into the gym and approach the first gym trainer.</p>

				<h3>Youngster Josh</h3>
				<p>Use Mudslap. Depending on your health, either use a potion or an Oran berry before the fight. This time you'll be using the accuracy curve to work for you. Spam Mud slap at the Geodude until it dies, and you learn Water Gun. Use your new toy to wreck the other two Geodudes.</p>
				<p>For experience, you can fight the second Youngster here too. However, he isn't required and there are easier sources of experience later, so it is only recommended to fight him if your SpAtk is bad.</p>

				<h3>Youngster Tommy</h3>
				<p>Water Gun</p>

				<h3>Leader Roxanne</h3>
				<p>Make sure to equip an Oran Berry here and use your last healing item. This is only possible if you didn't need to heal before either the Grunt or Josh, which is likely.</p>
				<p>Use Water Gun on Geodude, Water Gun on Nosepass (optional: Mud Slap Nosepass once). The Geodude is only a damage range at the worst possible SpA stats, obtained with either with a poor IV or an Adamant nature. This isn't a problem though, as half the time Geodude will use defense curl, and though it seems like you're wasting a turn, you actually bait one of Roxanne's 2 potions. The other half of the time, it will hit you with Rock Tomb, and you don't want that. In order to give yourself the best possible odds, you can use a single mud slap on Nosepass to give it 75% accuracy (that's 60% on rock tomb!). The best thing it can do is use harden up to 2 times. Other than this, healing won't save you, and you need to spam water gun while hoping your oran berry can carry you to the end. A timely crit here will blow past both of Roxanne's potions and save a ton of time.</p>
				<p>Note: You want to leave this fight at mid to low health in order to set up for HP manipulation on Rival 2. If you win the fight at below half health still holding your attached oran berry, make sure you take it off in the next menu.</p>
