				<p>Once we hit Petalburg, do not go into the Pokemon Center! Head straight for the gym.</p>
				<p>You are required to fight 3 gym trainers here, and the gimmick is that you get to pick what X item they use to open the battle (and the nature of your opponent's pokemon). Go left through the Speed door. If you haven't already, equip the Chesto. DON'T FORGET!!</p>

				<h3>Cool Trainer Randall</h3>
				<p>In either room you 3KO the Delcatty with Mud Shot. The only difference is that on the second turn, the speed boosted Delcatty goes first, having the chance to attract you (only if you're male), while the accuracy boosted one has a 73% chance of taking your Chesto berry should it use Sing.</p>
				<p>Following that, you have a choice between Defense (right) and Zero Reduction (left). Zero Reduction is recommended, but not before you heal. Re-equip Soft Sand.</p>

				<h3>Cool Trainer Parker</h3>
				<p>Both Linoones have the same HP and Defense, and while your Mud Shots aren't as effective against Parker in lowering it's speed, the lack of a defense upgrade gives you a 3KO versus a 4KO. You can use Mud Shot here to eek out the 3KO,though. You'll take 2 hits from both Linoones, but the difference between these fights is half a turn and 4 Mud Shot PP, both in favor of Parker.</p>
				<p>Take the single door you have available here, marked Attack. Heal to full before the next fight too.</p>

				<h3>Cool Trainer Jody</h3>
				<p>Her Zangoose gets one turn to attack, but that turn is enough to deal a lot of damage. Make sure that you're healed before the fight. Use 2 Mud Shots followed by Strength to be as fast as possible while conserving Mud Shot PP. If you've hit lots of spinners up to this point, you might get the 2 hit KO and might also outspeed the Zangoose on the second turn, rendering this fight mostly harmless</p>

				<p>Finally, we're ready to take on Norman. Heal to full and equip chesto if you still have it. Make sure Soft Sand is NOT equipped to Marshtomp for this battle, just remove it and hold nothing if you don't have the Chesto.</p>

				<h3>Leader Norman</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Start with an X Defend. This way you don't get 2KOed by Facade (but beware of crits, they negate stat boosts and will kill you!). Follow that with 3 X Attacks. If you had 9 speed at level 5, you should also use an X Speed. 3 strengths following this should finish him off nicely without activating heal range (assuming you're not overleveled). You might need to use a 2nd X Defend to be able to tank 2 Facades if your Defense is extremely low, but this really only does apply to the lowest of the low, especially if you hit any spinners.</li>
					<li>Slaking will use Yawn sometimes, so hope you have that Chesto handy. If not, that's what the Heal Powders are for. Use them freely once you're setup, as the majority of other fights in the game only deal Confusion, which you have Persim Berries to counter.</li>
					<li>Use any Energy Roots you have left to heal on Truant turns when you get Facaded down to single digits.</li>
					<li>Vigoroth will die to a Mud Shot followed by a Strength. After the first Mud Shot heal to full for the final slaking.</li>
					<li>Having high health in this fight will make this Slaking favor Focus Punch which you can abuse to stun lock him. However, he will use Facade or Faint Attack if he can kill. The fastest way to kill Slaking is to Strength first turn, Rock Tomb second turn and finally strength him again. On the off chance you miss Rock Tomb, lucky for you its his Truant turn and you get a second attempt.</li>
