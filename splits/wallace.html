				<p>Menu:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Teach Dive to Swampert over Rock Tomb</li>
					<li>Equip a Persim Berry</li>
					<li>Use a Max Repel</li>
					<li>Head South</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Surfing is faster than diving, so your cue is a small rock in front of the sandbar where you convene after fighting Archie. Proceed into the Seafloor Cavern. You have 2 fights to deal with here, and you should equip a Persim for both. You also want to have 6 Surfs ready for this dungeon, which may or may not be the case after the last fight.</p>

				<h3>Aqua Admin Shelly</h3>
				<p>The Sharpedo will get one turn against you, and it usually hurts, but 2x Mud Shot will finish it. Regardless of your SpA, the Mightyena gets 2KOed by Surf, and top tier SpAtk Swamperts have a small chance to onehit it even without Torrent. If your nature isn't Adamant, or it is and your IV is really good, go for the Torrented OHKO.</p>

				<h3>Aqua Leader Archie</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Archie 2 still isn't easy. This and Tate and Liza are the only two fights where your Special Attack really matters. An Adamant Nature can lose you a turn or 2 here.</li>
					<li>Mightyena gets 2KOed by Surf here in most cases; only the lowest IVs for a neutral nature and the bottom half for an Adamant nature come down to a damage range. If it uses Swagger (very common), take advantage of your burned persim and use your +1 Attack to 2KO it with Strength instead. You may still need your Surfs...</li>
					<li>Crobat is the one pokemon in the game where you just have to have hit the money on your SpA. In almost every case, it will get 3KOed consistently with Surf. In the best possible case, you barely eek out a Surf + Torrented Surf KO. +1 Strength is also a 3KO, so you can't really run away with this one. Confuse ray sucks, and Air Cutter does undesirable damage. Keep your health in check, and don't choke.</li>
					<li>Sharpedo will get an Attack off and the Mud Shot is a damage range at +1. Whether you outspeed it on the second hit is dependent on your IV, the top half of the 0-31 range will give you the second turn. It won't matter if by some miracle Archie decided not to use his Super Potions on his other pokemon (He has a very itchy trigger finger). Many runners decide for consistency to pick up Earthquake and use it to save up to 2 turns - it almost always onehits the Sharpedo. Teaching the TM takes time, though.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Enjoy the conference on the sandbar, and prepare to fight Kyogre. Surf over to Sootopolis City. Again your dive cue is a rock in front of the mountain, and you don't have to fight any trainers. Loop around to the Cave of Origin. Navigate it without Flash. Don't forget to pick up Waterfall, though it is really hard to miss. Catch the Kyogre and prepare for a long menu:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Teach the Kyogre Surf in the first slot, Thunderbolt in the second slot. Teach Swampert Waterfall over MudShot.</li>
					<li>Use any leftover Rare Candies on Kyogre, though having any depends on either Zigzagoon's Pickup or hitting a few spinners before the Swampert evolution. You don't need any, but they can help especially if you got unlucky on the Kyogre stats.</li>
					<li>If you still have a Persim berry, equip it on Kyogre. If not, give Kyogre the Mystic Water.</li>
					<li>Use the Escape Rope and leave.</li>
					<li>Swap Swampert with Kyogre and check Kyogre's stats for reference.</li>
					<li>Fly back to Sootoplis (spam A once selected Fly)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Solve the puzzles and fight Wallace:</p>
				<h3>Leader Wallace</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>This is the one fight where Kyogre's ability can work against you - Luvdisc and Seaking both have Swift Swim, doubling their speed in the rain you start up. This makes them outspeed you under normal circumstances, though if your Speed IV is good or you have a +Speed nature, you can X Speed to outspeed them and make this fight a little safer.</li>
					<li>Thunderbolt strats make the damage ranges in this fight a lot easier to hit. Luvdisc and Sealeo go down to an unboosted Thunderbolt, Whiscash goes down to your rain-boosted Surf, and Seaking has a very good chance to die to a Thunderbolt with even the lowest SpAtk IVs. The biggest danger here is getting confused multiple times, since pretty much everything will use Water Pulse on you given the chance.</li>
					<li>Milotic goes down safely to two Thunderbolts without risking potion range.</li>
