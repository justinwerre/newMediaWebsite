				<p>Proceed to Mauville, ensuring that you dodge the trainers. Be careful of Collector Edwin, he has 2 grass pokemon!</p>
				<p>Proceed to the Southeast house to get Rock Smash. Then head to the bike shop and pick the Mach Bike. Once outside, use a Super Potion if you plan to, teach Rock Smash to your slave, then register and use your bike. Step into the Mauville Pokemon Center (for later teleportation) and heal there if you don't want to waste a Super Potion. Head out and talk to Wally. </p>

				<h3>Wally 1</h3>
				<p>Goes down to a single Mud Shot</p>
				<p>Head into the Gym, and head in the direction which only forces you to fight 2 trainers: </p>

				<h3>Battle Girl Vivian</h3>
				<p>Her Meditite is capable of trolling you with detect. You 2KO it with Mud Shot, so if it uses bide, you're in the clear. Patterns where it uses another attack are also good, but they don't eliminate the possibility of more detects. Heal before Shawn if you are low on HP, since you can get very unlucky and take a lot of damage on the next couple of fights.</p>

				<h3>Guitarist Shawn</h3>
				<p>Shawn has 3 Voltorbs, and he worst they can do is use sonicboom. A Mud Shot deals with every one of them, so if you're above 60 health or see them use any other attack, you're good.</p>
				
				<h3>Leader Wattson</h3>
				<p>Now that you're ground type, Wattson isn't so harsh.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All of his pokemon enjoy using Sonicboom as their damaging move of choice. Keep that in mind when calculating when you need to heal, especially if you think confusion damage can take you below 20 HP. It's also good to be above 60 HP going in, so keep that in mind.</li>
					<li>The only bad thing that can happen to you is a supersonic from the Magnemite or Magneton. They each get one turn against you before biting the dust, so this is a possibility.</li>
					<li>Very rarely, the Voltorb will use Selfdestruct on you. If this happens, you can kiss your chances goodbye. Its AI seems to heavily tend away from using it, however.</li>
