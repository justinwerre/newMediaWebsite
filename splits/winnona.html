				<p>Step into the Fortree Pokemon Center and leave without healing. Walk across the bridges and leave for route 120.</p>
				<p>The road to Mt. Pyre is long and filled with trainers, but again, you can skip every last one of them. Repel before stepping into the long grass and head to Steven. When you have to fight the wild Kecleon, run from it. The bird keeper who guards the way immediately after Steven gives you a Devon Scope is quite annoying to dodge, so keep your reflexes sharp. Before heading to route 122, get the hidden rare candy on the bottom edge of the lake below the Sealed Cave. Before heading in to Mt. Pyre, stop by Liliycove City for a brief instant. Merely touching a tile of the town lets you fly there after beating Winona. If you sill don't have a Flyer, the small Route 122 holds a combined 40% chance of Wingull/Pelipper, but they aren't as easy to catch as another Flyer would have been earlier, and this is your ABSOLUTE last chance. The mountain itself houses 3 grunts:</p>

				<h3>Team Aqua Grunt 8/9/10</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The first and third Zubats usually die to Strength, but the second has high enough defense to require a Rock Tomb</li>
					<li>The Poochyena is a slight damage range with Strength if your Attack IV is on the low end of acceptable, so if you don't know for sure, be safe and use Mud Shot.</li>
					<li>All the Carvanhas still need Mud Shots</li>
				</ul>

				<p>After Archie runs away, you can pick up one last Rare Candy from the bottom patch of grass on the northeast part of the mountain. Provided you hit Level 33 (which you will have if you got Marshtomp in Granite Cave then proceeded with the rest of this route).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use your 3 Rare Candies to evolve to Swampert now, if you didn't already.</li>
					<li>Heal to full if you need</li>
					<li>Equip another Persim Berry for Winona.</li>
					<li>Teach Fly to your Flier</li>
					<li>Finally swap the second member of your party with Castform and Teleport back to Fortree.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Proceed directly to Winona's Gym. We have 2 lined up to fight, the other 2 are surprisingly dodgeable. The ones you fight are the first two you see:</p>

				<h3>Bird Keeper Jared</h3>
				<p>If you're a Swampert he will die to a Strength, otherwise Rock Tomb</p>

				<h3>Picknicker Kylee</h3>
				<p>Her Swablu also needs a Rock Tomb. This can be a damage range even as Swampert, Strength to finish it off if necessary.</p>
				<p>If you skipped extra experience earlier, you should now be level 33. Use your 3 rare candies and evolve into Swampert. Equip the Persim Berry, then proceed through the rest of the gym to fight the leader:</p>

				<h3>Leader Winona</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can't OHKO the Swellow with anything unboosted, but after a single X Attack, Rock Tomb will do the job. It loves to open with Double team, however, so you may be feeling the full effect of that 80% accuracy when it's compounded with a 75% or 60% cut. Don't expect to slow it down to your level on Rock Tombs alone. You want the +1 boost going in to the rest of the fight, and actually this is the most consistent option. Assuming 2 double teams, +1 Rock Tomb is .48 while 2 Strengths is .4, and going for the damage range on +1 Strength is less than .3. Ah well, at least you don't die if it misses.</li>
					<li>You can now safely 2KO the Pelipper with Strength. The Persim guards against the worst case scenario.</li>
					<li>Skarmory gets 2KOed with surf pretty safely. You won't lose out on the 2KO with poor IVs/nature, and you shouldn't trigger a Hyper Potion on higher values. You can go for a Torrented OHKO if you know you really lucked out on your IV, but this is risky, as it's still a damage range. It has Sand Attack, but prefer to Aerial Ace you in pretty much every situation.</li>
					<li>You can 2KO Altaria evenly with Strength on +1, so again, the kill is ensured without triggering Potions. A +1 Earthquake from the Altaria Hurts, so you may want to heal on the Skarmory.</li>
					<li>All in all, this fight isn't particularly dangerous, and marks a transition into the much less lethal portion of the game. You can still lose time, though, so be on your guard!</li>
