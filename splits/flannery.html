				<p>Immediately after beating Wattson, travel west to Verdanturf, dodging every trainer in your path. Be especially careful of the pokemon breeders, as they each have 6 pokemon, wasting a ton of time. If you move two tiles down from the exit of the gym and then hold left on your Mach Bike, you will dodge all but the last Breeder easily, but you'll have to pass him manually. Go directly to Rusturf tunnel and obtain Strength. You have a spare Repel if you want to use it here, but the distance is small enough that you can bet on encounter luck. Leave the tunnel and use Teleport to return to Mauville.</p>
				<p>You'll have to use 2 repels to get to Fallarbor: 1 before moving through the grass on Route 112, and one before stepping into the ashen grass in Route 113. When you get to that first location:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Bonk into the line of trees</li>
					<li>Use a Repel</li>
					<li>Teach Marshtomp Strength over Tackle</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are many trainers to dodge on the way up, so do the best you can. Through all of Route 111 and 112, there is exactly one required trainer:</p>
				<h3>Cool Trainer Brooke</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Cool Trainer Brooke is nontrivial. Her lead is a Wingull which is packing Supersonic, a recipe for disaster if you remain confused against the next pokemon. *If you get confused, this is a good time to use your Full Heal, which heals confusion. Also, Wingull tends to use growl when you are at higher HP, so sometimes it is fine to be lower health entering this fight. Use an extra X attack if this does happen.</li>
					<li>The Roselia dies to a +1 Strength. It has natural cure, so don't worry about using a contact move. However, this also means you have to use an X Attack against the Wingull to ensure the KO before it gets you with mega drain. This gives her more of a chance to hit with supersonic.</li>
					<li>If Attack is +1, strength the numel. Otherwise, Water Gun takes out the remaining Numel.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Shop 3</h3>
				<p>Once in Fallarbor, head to the left side of town and pick up the hidden Nugget inside the crater below the main path. Now head slightly back to the town's Pokemart, where you will make the majority of your remaining purchases for the game.</p>

				<h4>Sell</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Shock Wave</li>
					<li>Nugget</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Buy</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>8 Super Repels</li>
					<li>3 X Specials</li>
					<li>8-9 X Attacks (9 if bad attack and you want to 100% kill Rival 3's grovyle)</li>
					<li>5-6 X Speeds</li>
					<li>1 X Defend (2 if -Def nature with low Defense IV &amp; few spinners hit)</li>
					<li>1 Guard Spec</li>
					<li>1 Escape Rope (if used in Granite Cave)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you aren't using Thunderbolt strats, you won't be able to sell Shock Wave here - instead, you will need to get replacement money (from Zigzagoon Pickup items or spinners hit) or buy less items earlier on. Pretty much all of these X items are required, however. You need to have 8 X Attacks when you leave here, but you might have one left over if Rival 2 and Brooke played nice, so adjust your buy accordingly. The case where you need 2 X Defends is very rare, so it can be ignored most of the time. But it will waste a lot of time in a race/marathon if you have to go to Petalburg Mart to buy a second one after seeing that you are taking too much damage from Norman, so be wary.</p>

				<p>Leave the town and proceed down route 114. Move behind Lanette's House and down the right side of the route. Pick 4 of the Persim Berries and move to Meteor Falls, dodging all of the trainers (In a race, you can opt to pick up all 6, though it is very unlikely that you'll need the extras). Do not use a repel on this route if you need a Flyer. You have a 40% chance to find a Swablu here, which will suffice. Again, you have a spare repel if you already have a Flyer, though. Once you enter meteor falls use a Super Repel, head left for the cut scene then leave the cave the same way you came in, and Teleport all the way back to Mauville.</p>

				<p>Heal in the Pokemon Center you just spawned at for the PP. Move up to the now unobstructed cable car in the same manner as before. Get ready to fight a few trainers:</p>
				<h3>Team Aqua Grunt 5</h3>
				<p>One benefit of having a good attack stat is that you are not forced to use Rock Tomb or Mud Shot here. Strength will OHKO both pokemon.</p>

				<h3>Aqua Admin Matt</h3>
				<p>Mud Shot the Carvanhas to avoid Rough Skin text, and use Strength on Poochyena</p>

				<p>Prepare to fight Archie.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Switch Zigzagoon to the front of the party</li>
					<li>Equip Persim Berry to Marshtomp.</li>
					<li>Heal the Marshtomp as well.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Aqua Leader Archie</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mightyena: Use Guard Spec Turn 1. Switch in Marshtomp after Ziggy faints. Use 1 X Attack, 1 X Speed and use mud shot 2 times on mightyena.</li>
					<li>Golbat: Use strength twice (rock tomb first turn if speed IV is less than 14)</li>
					<li>Sharpedo: Mud Shot twice</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Leave for Lavaridge town and remember not to hit up the Pokemon Center. If you need to heal and you're out of super potions, take shop 5 now!</p>
				<p>You can avoid every trainer in this gym by going in the right holes. After the first jump choose Top Left, followed by Mid Left, then Top Right, then Bottom Left. Heal before Flannery, and if you picked them, equip a Cheri Berry.</p>

				<h3>Leader Flannery</h3>
				<p>Use an X attack on the second Slugma, and kill both with Mud Shot. Mudshot twice the Torkoal. The reason we used an X atack was to set up for the 2KO on Torkoal. The only thing that can stop us is if his Body Slam paralyzes the Marshtomp (30%) which is what the Cheri Berry is for. Keep in mind that the Torkoal knows Attract, making the rarer female Mudkip slightly more consistent. Its AI in this particular game loves to use Body Slam on turn 1, however.</p>
