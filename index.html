				<p>To begin, Pokemon Sapphire is preferred because the late game benefits of using Kyogre over Groudon and Swampert in the end outweigh the meager early game benefits of fighting the water-weak Team Magma in the beginning. In this game, the gender differences are actually minimal. Outside of a few frames of difference based on which house you spawn in and the number of letters in the words "May" and "Brandon", there is only one gameplay difference to worry about. While Brandon and May's pokemon have the same stats, in the second rival fight, May will send out her Wailmer first, while Brandon sends out the Numel. This is the hardest fight in the game for a number of reasons, and the difference here is actually a point of consistency. You need to set up 2 X attacks, 1 X speed, and heal up before killing your rival's first pokemon, and they are not allowed to use growl while this happens. The AI is such that it is much more likely to use growl when your health is higher, and this is where the difference lies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Wailmer deals more damage with water gun, and has the chance to use splash. This means he has a chance of forcing you to heal before you normally would, potentially causing a premature growl. If you're in higher health, while he may use splash, if he does, he still has a chance of using growl the next turn. A lucky splash at mid health may be just the turn you need, however. Wailmer also dies in 2 hits, needing a tackle and a mud shot.</li>
					<li>Numel does less damage with both tackle and ember, so even if you are on lower health, he won't be able to kill you. Ember has a 10% chance to burn, however. This, while slim, is undesirable because of the resulting attack cut. Additionally, at higher health, its attacks won't bring you out of growl range immediately. Numel will die in one mud shot, however.</li>
				</ul>
